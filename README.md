Motor Imagery (MI) for Left vs Right Hand Imaged Movement Prediction with Electroencephalography (EEG).


This project finds a machine learning model to differentiate two motor imagery events detected by EEG signals. The subjects were prompted to imagine left vs right hand movement and the neural pattern of the subjects were recorded through the EEG and EOG data. Complex time-series data visualization and analysis in both time- domain and frequency-domain generated insights to extract physiological features. Four machine learning models were introduced to predict if the subject was thinking left vs right-hand movement. Then the best model with tuned parameters were selected through cross validation. The prediction accuracy of the best selected model is 74.86%, which shows advantages over a CNN model with an accuracy of 72.01%.
